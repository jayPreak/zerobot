# Zero Two Frames Bot

Hello there! This repository hosts the code of a Twitter bot that's posting every single frame from the beloved anime 'Darling in the Franxx', one frame per hour.

## What's the aim?

By the time this bot finishes its job, it will have posted every still image from the entire series. Essentially, you'll be able to see the entire series as a collection of still images right here on Twitter.

## Acknowledgments

This project wouldn't have been possible without the code and inspiration from two incredible developers:

- [Boidushya](https://github.com/Boidushya) - Check out their GitHub profile for more innovative projects!
- [Pigeonburger](https://github.com/Pigeonburger) - Check out their GitHub profile for more interesting code!

Their contributions to the open-source community were instrumental in bringing this project to life. Big thanks to both of them!

## Stay Tuned

Make sure to follow the bot on Twitter to catch all frames from Darling in the Franxx!
